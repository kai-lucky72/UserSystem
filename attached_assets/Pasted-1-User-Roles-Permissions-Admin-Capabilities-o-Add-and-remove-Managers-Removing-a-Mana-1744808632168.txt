If no password is set, the user logs in solely with Work ID and email.

After successful login, the system identifies the user’s role (Admin, Manager, or Agent) based on Work ID and email.
o
o
Users are then redirected to the appropriate dashboard.
o

Unrecognized Users:

o
If invalid credentials are entered, the system provides a built-in email help form.
o
o
Help requests are sent to the Admin’s email for review and resolution.

o
Backend

Framework:

Spring Boot (Java) for the RESTful API.
o

API Communication:

o
RESTful endpoints ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
o
Database

Database Engine:

o
PostgreSQL or MySQL.
o

User Table Fields:

o
ID
o
o
firstName
o
o
lastName

Security & Authentication

JWT Tokens:


Used for secure login and session handling.
o

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

o
Enforced via middleware to restrict endpoint access based on the user’s role.
o

Optional Passwords:

o
Passwords are only managed if the user opts in; otherwise, authentication is based solely on Work ID and email.
o
Email & Notifications

Email Integration:

o
Utilizes Spring Boot’s email libraries (or services like SendGrid) to send notifications.
o

Notifications:

o
Managers: Receive notifications about agent activity.
o
o
Agents: Receive automated reminders (e.g., attendance alerts).
o
o
Unrecognized Login Attempts: Trigger email help requests to be sent to Admin.
o
